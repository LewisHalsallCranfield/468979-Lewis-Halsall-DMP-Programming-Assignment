Application for submission for Digital Maths and Programming - Programming Assignment.

My project has been managed using GitHub as repository, GitBash as a client for Git CLI operations Atlassian Jira as a Kanban board. It was programmed in Visual Studio Code in Python. The GitLog has been included in the uploaded Zip file containing source code on Canvas. Dependencies have been listed in the requirements file. My project was built iteratively with version control (Git) and used Jira to track planning and working tasks. I used Python's Anaconda distribution to manage dependencies. 

AI Use Declaration: As per assignment brief, I declare that I used generative AI for one single task - to create a .csv file that contained 50 tasks of varying priority, due dates and completion status. This was in order to make my data visualisation more meaningful for demo and display purposes. All other programming in this assignment was done by myself.

# LH To-Do Tracker application
LH To-Do Tracker is a command-line personal task tracker which also uses Jupyter notebook to display some data analysis and visualisation.

Features of LH To-Do Tracker include:
    - The ability to add/view/delete/complete input tasks.
    - Storage of tasks as Pandas dataframes.
    - Exception handling and input error handling.
    - Condition logic and menu operation.
    - Metadata such as priority levels, due dates et cetera.
    - Visualisation of some task statistics as bar charts, line plot and a pie chart.
    - Persistance in the form of saving and loading to a CSV file.
    - A Core application ready for graphical user interface upgrade using Python GUI libraries.

File Structure:
    - LH_ToDo_Tracker.py
    - task_analysis.ipynb
    - tasks.csv
    - README.MD
    - requirements.txt

Future Work:
    - User-interface.
    - Ability to edit tasks post input.
    - Create a user login function with session persistance.
